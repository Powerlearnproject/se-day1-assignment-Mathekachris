Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering- is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining of software application.
Importance of software engineering in technology industry
1. It helps to optimize developer workflow while maintaining high quality standards.
2. It serves as a force for change by prepelling digital transformation,unearthing data insights, upholding security, and fuelling economic expansion.
3. It enables the digital transformation of industries, driving efficiency, innovation, and new business models.
4. It ensures that the system can handle an increased load without effecting performance.
   

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Mastering the machine.
2. Mastering the market.
3. Mastering the process.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirement analysis- seeks to identify and record the precise requirments of the final users.
2. Planning- involves defining the software's purpose and scope.
3. Design- this phase is all about building the framework.
4. Coding-the coding phase is when engineers and developers get down to business and start converting the software design into tangible code.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology- is a rigid, highly structured approach that requires the execution of the project to be defined before any work can begin.
a). Waterfall focuses on defining project budget, timelines and making it predictable methodology.
b). moves slower than other methodology.
c). there is low flexibility.
Agile methodology- agile projects are all highly complementary to the practise of risk management.
a). provides clear visibility and transparency throughout the project lifecycle
b).agile teams are often faster and more efficientthan others.
c). high flexibility, adapts to changing requirement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers- design, program,build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools.
a). maitaining and updating software to keep it functional.
b). reporting to the project manager about the progress of the software development.
c). create new applications for any given market.
Quality Assurance Engineer
a). prevent defects
b). they are responsible for identifying and eliminating any mistakes in code before its release to customers.
c). develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
Project manager
a). for planning, scheduling and managing the delivery of software and web project.
b)traacking milestones and KPIs
c). organising and leading team meetings
d)testing final products and ensuring quality is high.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergated Development Environment(IDEs)- is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.
Importance:
1. code editing automation- programming language have rules for how statements must be structured. An IDEs knows these rules.
2. IDEs increase programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code change.
3. The IDEs allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is intergrated with other developers code and more complex intergration test are run.
4. Debugging IDE enables a step through the code, line by line, as it runs and inspects code behavior.
Version Control System (VCS)- are software tools taht help software teams manage changes to source code over time.
Importance:
1. Error Recovery- allows revertin to previous version if a new changes introduce errors.
2. Branching and Merging- Supports creating branches for a new features and merging them back into the man code.
3. Change Tracking- Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Software security- Programming secure software is a complex and challenging task.
   solution: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.
2. Sofware Accessibility and Usability-Overly complex software can frustrate or confuse users
   solution: use scalable architecture, emphasize reliability.
3. Limited infrastructure- limited high-performance software engineering tools and computing platforms and inefficient data storage architectures.
   solution: software engineers must rely heavily on a robot infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests- are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software.
System testing- Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
-it helps to verify that the system meets all functional and non- functional requirements
Acceptance tests- are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirments
-Whether the software meets the need of the end-users and is ready for deployment.
Integration tests- verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
-help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering- is the process of structuring or crafting an instruction in orderr to produce the best possible output from a generative artificial intelligence model.
Importance:
1. Improved user experience-it helpes mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models training data.
2. Increased flexibility- a prompt engineer can create prompts with domain- meutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
